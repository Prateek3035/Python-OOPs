        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" that bundle data (attributes) and code (methods) together. It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and the modeling of real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior (data and methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - An object is an instance of a class that contains actual data and can use the class's methods. It represents a specific realization of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "   - Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features, while encapsulation restricts direct access to data by wrapping it with methods, promoting data protection.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Dunder methods (like __init__, __str__) are special methods with double underscores used to customize object behavior, such as initialization, representation, or operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent), enabling code reuse and hierarchical relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism lets objects of different classes be treated as objects of a common superclass, typically by overriding methods to perform class-specific behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation in Python is done by using private (_ or __) attributes and providing getter/setter methods or @property to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "   - A constructor in Python is the __init__ method that initializes a new object with default or user-defined values when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "   - Class methods use @classmethod and access class-level data, while static methods use @staticmethod and don't access class or instance data; they behave like regular functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   - Python doesn't support traditional method overloading; instead, it uses default arguments or *args and **args to handle different numbers of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "   - Method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the same name and parameters as one in its parent class, replacing its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "   - The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access to instance variables in a readable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism is important because it enables flexibility and scalability by allowing one interface to be used with different underlying forms (classes).\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "   - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (declared using @abstractmethod) that must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "   - OOP offers modularity, code reusability, scalability, easy maintenance, and the ability to model complex systems using inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - A class variable is shared among all instances of a class, while an instance variable is unique to each object and defined in the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their behaviors and attributes, but it can lead to method resolution conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"__str__' and '__repr__\" methods in Python?\n",
        "   - __str__ returns a user-friendly string for print(), while __repr__ returns a developer-oriented string useful for debugging and ideally recreating the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the 'super()' function in Python?\n",
        "   - super() is used to call methods from a parent class, especially in constructors and method overriding, ensuring proper method resolution in inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed, often used to release resources like files or network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "   - @staticmethod doesnâ€™t take any implicit first argument, while @classmethod takes cls as the first argument and can modify class state or create new instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "   - Polymorphism with inheritance allows child classes to override methods of parent classes, enabling the same method call to behave differently based on the object's class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "   - Method chaining involves calling multiple methods on an object in a single line by returning self from each method, allowing a fluent coding style.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - The __call__ method allows an object to be called like a function, enabling instances of classes to behave like callable functions.\n"
